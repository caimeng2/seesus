# seesus: a social, environmental, and economic sustainability classifier

`seesus` is a **Python** software that evaluates whether a textual expression aligns with the concept of sustainability as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It labels a statement with the 17 SDGs as well as 169 specific targets and categorizes the statement into social, environmental, or economic sustainability. For analysis in **R**, please check [`SDGdector`](https://github.com/Yingjie4Science/SDGdetector){:target="_blank"}. `seesus` currently has four main functions:

1. Evaluate whether a statement aligns with sustainability
2. Identify SDGs and associated targets in a statement
3. Classify a statement into social, environmental, and economic sustainability
4. Examine and customize match syntax
