 abstractNote={In order to explore and extend our understanding of corporate sustainability definitions and frameworks, we performed a content analysis of a sample of (2013) Fortune 500 companies’ standalone sustainability reports using the content analysis tool, Leximancer (http://leximancer.com). Leximancer is a powerful content analysis tool that performs both conceptual and thematic analysis. In addition, Leximancer displays the results of the analyses visually, thus providing a view of the conceptual and thematic structure of the text, and enabling a researcher to quantify and display the text structure. The results of our analyses demonstrate three common themes (Business, Employees and Energy/Environment) observable across eight of the nine industries in our sample. In addition, we observed significant differences in the relative emphasis for the three common themes across industries. We believe a deeper understanding of the themes that motivate firms’ sustainability efforts can enhance future research that explores relationships between organizational sustainability efforts and organizational performance.},

 title={Sustainable development benefits of clean development mechanism projects: A new methodology for sustainability assessment based on text analysis of the project design documents submitted for validation},
 volume={36},
 ISSN={0301-4215},
 DOI={10.1016/j.enpol.2008.02.039},
 abstractNote={The clean development mechanism (CDM) is part of the global carbon market developing rapidly in response to global warming. It has the twin objective to achieve sustainable development (SD) in host countries and assist Annex-1 countries in achieving their emission reduction targets in a cost-efficient manner. However, research has shown that trade-offs between the two objectives exist in favour of cost-efficient emission reductions and that left to the market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development. The main argument of the paper is the need for an international standard for sustainability assessment—additional to national definitions—to counter weaknesses in the existing system of sustainability approval by designated national authorities in host countries. The article develops a new methodology, i.e. a taxonomy for sustainability assessment based on text analysis of the 744 project design documents (PDDs) submitted for validation by 3 May 2006. Through analysis of the SD benefits of all CDM projects at aggregated levels, the strengths and limitations of the taxonomy are explored. The main policy implication of the research is to propose the taxonomy as the basis of an international verification protocol for designated operational entities (DOEs) for reporting, monitoring and verifying that potential SD benefits described in the PDDs are actually realized.},

 abstractNote={Despite concrete indicators and targets, monitoring the progress of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains a challenge, given the many different actors, initiatives, and institutions involved. OSDG, an open-source classification tool aims to help navigate the SDG related ambiguities through a simple and easy to use application. The tool allows to map and connect activities to the SDGs by identifying SDG -relevant content in any text. This paper presents OSDG 2.0, a new iteration of the partnership’s work, which marks a significant improvement in the tool’s methodology, as well as support for content in 15 languages.},

 title={Methodological characteristics of sustainability science: a systematic review},
 volume={19},
 ISSN={1573-2975},
 DOI={10.1007/s10668-016-9801-z},
 abstractNote={Sustainability science has emerged as a research program and a scientific trend that directs all efforts to promote transition of societies toward sustainability. The style of research proposed to tackle unsustainability issues should be characterized by the application of a systems approach, as well as transdisciplinarity, participation, generation of social learning and a problem-solving perspective. However, whether such traits are being actually implemented has not been determined. Furthermore, a mature science is expected to have coherent research typologies, besides a scientific community and shared theoretical assumptions and methodological prescriptions; such types or research on sustainability science is still unknown. This systematic review aimed at analyzing research papers on sustainability carried out in 2013. Three aspects were studied: the scientific community, the theoretical assumptions on the concept of sustainability and the methodological design. Results suggest that the scientific community comes from disciplines different to sustainability, the researchers tend not to define the concept of sustainability and among those who do, and there is a lack of shared assumptions. The present analysis also showed that research on sustainability has not implemented the methodological characteristics mentioned and coherent method typologies were not found. These aspects hinder sustainability science evolution and maturity, given the difficulty to construct theories and consolidate a scientific community that develops coherent methods on such grounds.},

 abstractNote={Higher education institutions (HEIs) are crucial social organizations that foster innovation, disseminate knowledge, and train future leaders in various fields. Higher education institutions are essential for implementing the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) plan. This review addresses HEIs’ attempts to evaluate sustainability in higher education. This study analyzes the literature available on the sustainability assessment of higher education institutions to provide a review of the practices incorporated by different HEIs around the globe. Using the Scopus database and Google Scholar, 88 articles were selected for this review. The analyzed literature provided information that helped compile an SAT list (Sustainability Assessment Tool). The SATs identified in these articles are categorized as qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method techniques. The utilization of these SATs in real-world case studies was also presented, and their results are highlighted. This analysis aids and contributes to current research on using these SATs and other methods for evaluating and implementing the sustainability of HEIs. This study also explains the difficulties and scope of utilizing these SATs in the actual world.},

 abstractNote={Every product or system that we consume or use affects our lives and the environment during its production, consumption and disposal. Emissions and wastes are generated which contaminate soil, water and air, the key life support systems on earth. If these support systems will stop functioning in their natural form, then survival and wellbeing of various living things will be endangered. Thus a product or a system should be conceived based on the principles of sustainability. There exist number of definitions on sustainability making it difficult to choose one for application. So in this paper we aim to discuss the definitions of sustainability from different contexts i.e., global and local, temporal and spatial, measurable and non-measurable, and clear and ambiguous. From the analysis we found most of the definitions are global, non-measurable and ambiguous. We need measurable and clear definitions of sustainability to be used in various situations.},

 ISSN={2071-1050},
 DOI={10.3390/su14053095},
 abstractNote={As sustainability gains popularity in public discourse, scholars have noted its diverse uses, multiple meanings, and contradictory outcomes. This paper explores how the current proliferation of the concept of sustainability stems in part from its varied normative appeals, which in turn motivate, legitimate, and unsettle its diverse mobilizations. As the concept of sustainability calls for an extension of moral horizons beyond the immediate here and now, this redrawing of moral boundaries has simultaneously produced new externalities as well as enduring anxieties and responses within these moral bounds themselves. Drawing on ethnographic and historical materials, we argue that sustainability’s moral boundaries have become both an object of scholarly critique and their own productive site of anxiety and negotiation. Questions about sustainability’s moral horizons and externalities often surface in the concept’s public deployment itself. We suggest that these tensions can be made visible by attending to the intersections between sustainability and a broader range of moral concerns at work.},
