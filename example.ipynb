Ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, and misinformation impede progress toward SDGs like gender equality (SDG 5) and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). Technical limitations also hinder AI's potential contributions, posing challenges to goals associated with clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7). Addressing these challenges necessitates global collaboration and policy frameworks that align with the SDG. This research delves into innovative approaches to effectively harness ChatGPT's capabilities, ensuring alignment with the SDG.

Moreover, it aids in information dissemination, supporting goals like zero hunger (SDG 2) and good health and well-being (SDG 3) by distributing vital agricultural and healthcare knowledge. Nevertheless, integrating AI, including ChatGPT, into sustainable development endeavors presents multifaceted challenges. Ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, and misinformation impede progress toward SDGs like gender equality (SDG 5) and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). Technical limitations also hinder AI's potential contributions, posing challenges to goals associated with clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7). Addressing these challenges necessitates global collaboration and policy frameworks that align with the SDG. This research delves into innovative approaches to effectively harness ChatGPT's capabilities, ensuring alignment with the SDG. By confronting ethical and technical challenges and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, generative AI can significantly augment the global pursuit of sustainable development, fostering a more inclusive, knowledgeable, and interconnected world.\"\n",
